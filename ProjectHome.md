After taking into to computer graphics at UVA I wanted to create a program that would make it a lot easier to make .ray files that are used by the renders I made for that class. The idea is to be able to run the OpenGL render from the creator then take a high quality render with the C++ render.


Project inactive. Currently it will generate a default scene, and has some ability to add objects.
